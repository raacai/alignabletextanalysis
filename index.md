# Analysis of Alignable Forum Discussion

## Focus to demonstrate the benefits of using A.I.

### Case: Text and sentiment analysis of Alignable digital marketing discussion post 

This post with the title: "What challenges have you faced marketing or selling your services online? What would you most like to learn about" had approximately **32k views** and **510 comments**. One of the most visualized posts in Alignable. That was my motivation to create a text and sentiment analysis. 

First analysis the main keywords of the title are:

.1 **"What challenges"**
.2 **"your services"**

It is so evident that small business owners are very interested to read and communicate the challenges which they are facing now. 

I was not able at first glance to see *when* this post was published. Forward I will create a temporal analysis to contextualize by the time the comments, and this will probably give us an idea of when it was published. 

Also, this title has more than 90% of neutral sentiment idea and just 10% of negative. What does it mean? The people are more attracted to a neutral question than positive or negative. 

The subtitle also gave us a great idea of the success of this post. 

**"Many businesses had to focus their efforts on their online presence this year. What questions do you have about improving your digital marketing or online sales?"**

Using the same AI keyword analysis we have:

.1 **Many businesses**
.2 **their efforts**
.3 **their online presence**
.4 **this year**
.5 **What questions**
.6 **your digital marketing**
.7 **online sales**

The flow idea makes sense since in the subtitle it evokes a solution **digital marketing** and the area of impact **online sales.** Also, the subtitle creates an identification with the reader, remember business owners, which are **doing their efforts to have an online presence.** Even if you are not doing efforts or not have a digital presence. Also, it provokes some curiosity in the theme of how the business, who actually are selling online are performing.

Also, here the sentiment is neutral. 

### Using AI tools in the benefit of small business owners 

For this analysis, I will use advance analytic software which will extract all the information in the Post. I will be focused on data that can be used to generate information that will support and expand the decision-making activities of small business owners.

As an example let's try to figure out how people feel about this theme, also, where they are located, what are the keywords of their comments and other important information. Once I have it, this will empower different types of business like advertising and coaches. 

So let's do it. 

### 1) Extracting the URL tags and creating the rational of output

If you want to see the public post that I will analyze just click [here.](https://www.alignable.com/forum/what-do-you-want-to-learn-about-digital-marketing-or-online-sales?_tid=851847&page=1)

Extract information from a site requires a good understanding of Html, CSS and java languages. So just a professional usually can do this type of extraction from a web site. But to make things more clear all sites are tagged. What does it mean that every section that you see in a page, like services, contact and so on has a tag and I will use those tags to make the extraction.

I will jump in what matters and show the final result of the extraction.
