# Analysis of Alignable Forum Discussion

## Focus to demonstrate the benefits of using A.I.

## Case: Text and sentiment analysis of Alignable digital marketing discussion post 

This post with the title: "What challenges have you faced marketing or selling your services online? What would you most like to learn about" had approximately **32k views** and **510 comments**. One of the most visualized posts in Alignable. That was my motivation to create a text and sentiment analysis. 

First analysis the main keywords of the title are:

. 1 **"What challenges"**
. 2 **"your services"**

It is so evident that small business owners are very interested to read and communicate the challenges which they are facing now. 

I was not able at first glance to see *when* this post was published. Forward I will create a temporal analysis to contextualize by the time the comments, and this will probably give us an idea of when it was published. 

Also, this title has more than 90% of neutral sentiment idea and just 10% of negative. What does it mean? The people are more attracted to a neutral question than positive or negative. 

The subtitle also gave us a great idea of the success of this post. 

**"Many businesses had to focus their efforts on their online presence this year. What questions do you have about improving your digital marketing or online sales?"**

Using the same AI keyword analysis we have:

. 1 **Many businesses**
. 2 **their efforts**
. 3 **their online presence**
. 4 **this year**
. 5 **What questions**
. 6 **your digital marketing**
. 7 **online sales**

The flow idea makes sense since in the subtitle it evokes a solution **digital marketing** and the area of impact **online sales.** Also, the subtitle creates an identification with the reader, remember business owners, which are **doing their efforts to have an online presence.** Even if you are not doing efforts or not have a digital presence. Also, it provokes some curiosity in the theme of how the business, who actually are selling online are performing.

Also, here the sentiment is neutral. 

### Using AI tools in the benefit of small business owners 

For this analysis, I will use advance analytic software which will extract all the information in the Post. I will be focused on data that can be used to generate information that will support and expand the decision-making activities of small business owners.

As an example let's try to figure out how people feel about this theme, also, where they are located, what are the keywords of their comments and other important information. Once I have it, this will empower different types of business like advertising and coaches. 

So let's do it. 

### Extracting the URL tags and creating the rational of output

If you want to see the public post that I will analyze just click [here.](https://www.alignable.com/forum/what-do-you-want-to-learn-about-digital-marketing-or-online-sales?_tid=851847&page=1)

Extract information from a site requires a good understanding of Html, CSS and java languages. So just a professional usually can do this type of extraction from a web site. But to make things more clear all sites are tagged. What does it mean? Well, that every section that you see in a page, like services, contact and so on has a tag. Those you can see but it is use to show images, links, forms and even for Google Analytics. Since, you understand that, I will use those tags to make the extraction of this Alignable post data.

I will jump in what matters and show the final result of the extraction.

So that is it! I scrapped all comments of business owners(but just show you only 5!). 

### Now what?

Well, now we can select the comments by sentiment. For example, if people write a negative comment, it means that the business owner is stuck, snot using or even having bad results from their online activity. Marketing, advertising and other specialists can use this information to reach these people and offer their services.

More, we can see the keywords of the comments, and filtering people. Example, let's say I am interested in people that comment **not successful** or **bad results**. So I understand they need to have a supportive approach to what they are doing. Another example, if I select people who comment **none** so a specialist can reach this guy and show the benefits of having a good online presence.

Also, let's suppose that I am interested to learn with people who are having success in online marketing. I can select then from positive sentiment and keywords. Reach them by Alignable platform and build a new connection. I can choose people by location too.  

Sometimes, people are interested to understand which day people are more **availabe** to see and write a comment. This is important when we are trying to reach the **correct message, to right people in the best time.**
The graph below is another example of how we can do that.



<img src="images/Acommentsgraph.png?raw=true"/>
**Number of comments throug a week**

Or even the sentiment.

**Emotional valence of the comments through week**

**Emotional valence of the comments through week**

Much more can be done. **AI it is most powerful tool that a business owner can have to overcome the challenges of a COVID era.**

## A post overview analysis

**AI can do more for you and your business.** Let's say you are interested not in a specific person but the overall information about the comments. Its is possible?

Sure! I will show you some examples below.

We can also try to make sense of the post analyzing the different trigram. A trigram is a group of three consecutive written units such as letters, syllables, or words. This helps us to find out the main sequence of 3 words in the Alignable discussion post.
